# CTAMACE
A web app to predict major cardiovascular 
events (MACE) two years following 
coronary multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)

**CTA:** Computed Tomography Angiography  
**MACE:** Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events
## Background
A related article with title "Comparison of 
Conventional vs. Machine Lerning scoring for 
prediction of Major Cardiovascular Event
 Using Coronary Multidetector Computed Tomography" was published, training seven ML algorithms.
